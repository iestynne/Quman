# Quman

This project is a minimal PixiJS application built with TypeScript and Vite. It displays a red button that changes color when clicked.

## Development

1. Install dependencies (requires Node.js and npm):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open the URL printed by Vite (typically `http://localhost:5173`) in your browser.

The `vite` server automatically reloads when files change.
